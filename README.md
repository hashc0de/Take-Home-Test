# Take-Home-Test

Ques 1. What's your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you've worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it, what impact it had (If any) and any insights you took from it.

My proudest achievement was with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce(CIBC) where I and my team redesigned and developed Dynamic Currency Conversation application.


The biggest problem customer was facing is with the slowness of system, a lot of bugs and it takes a significant amount of time to ship solution to production. so we took this as starting point and analyze the system and came up with new designed and technology stack requirement and also did a POC to showcase our thoughts to the business customer.


We also pitched in the idea of converting this as a product which was highly appreciated by the customer and now this project is adding 10 million extra revenue per annum for the client since its launch.


The reason I am really proud of this project not only we met the expectation of client but also tried to go beyond it by adding some value to client and their process apart from this project was highly appreciated for code quality and no post production failure and clients were so happy and excited with this projects launch that they gave us few more project to improve and also invested some more time, effort and money to cover many numbers of currency(initially started with 10 Currency and with latest implementation we are covering 56 currencies) for DCC project.


Ques 2. Write a function that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] â†’ [1,2,3,4]. If the language you're using has a function to flatten arrays, you should pretend it doesn't exist.

Ques 3. We have some customer records in a text file (customers.json) -- one customer per line, JSON-encoded. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).
